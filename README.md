# University Risk and Display

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Information for Users

This project is compiled using open source / publicly available data such as HESA EMR and UK open data from https://www.data.gov.uk.


### User Manual 
This section provides a description of all the information that is found on the React page and how to best use the data in the presented format. 

The linked page opens to the whole UK with universities listed as dots on the map. On the left hand side, there is a panel with a list of universities. Clicking on your university of interest will bring you directly to a pin location and show the land use breakdown as of 2024. The pins are color coded by cluster. A description of the clusters is found in the collapsable panel on the right hand side.
